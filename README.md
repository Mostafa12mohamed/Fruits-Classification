# Fruit Classification Project
## Project at Nti Summer Training

### Fruit Classification using Deep Learning!
In this project, I implemented several state-of-the-art models to accurately classify different types of fruits:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- VGG16
- AlexNet
- ResNet
###### These deep learning architectures allowed me to explore feature extraction and image classification at a deeper level. Each model brought unique insights into improving classification performance, and I learned a great deal about optimizing neural networks for accuracy and efficiency.
